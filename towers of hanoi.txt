% Predicate to solve Towers of Hanoi
hanoi(N) :-
    move(N, left, center, right).

% Base case: Move zero disks (no action needed)
move(0, _, _, _) :- !.

% Recursive case: Move N disks from Src to Dst using Aux as auxiliary tower
move(N, Src, Dst, Aux) :-
    N > 0,
    M is N - 1,
    move(M, Src, Aux, Dst),    % Move N-1 disks from Src to Aux using Dst
    write('Move disk from '), write(Src),
    write(' to '), write(Dst), nl,
    move(M, Aux, Dst, Src).    % Move N-1 disks from Aux to Dst using Src
